# Family Grocery Kata
A very simple python kata, for clean code basic exercise.

## Requirements
Queue kata simulate a queue at the Family grocery store.
* First-in-first-out (FIFO) queue
* Senior citizen got prioritized in the queue, senior age starts from 62 years old
* Among senior citizens, FIFO applies
* Some items can't be bought by customer under 18 and senior citizens: `cigarette`, `alcohol`. Any findings will be *excluded* from the queue

## How to
Refactor the initial code so that the code reflects clean code principles.
* Readable, easy to understand
* Extensible, easy to add new feature

The exercise steps:
* Create your own branch using pattern `kata/<github username>`
* Refactor the code, run `pytest` to ensure your code is running correctly
* Create a Pull Review and request

Bonus:
* Spot and fix inefficient code
* Cover edge cases
* Make testing more readable and cover more cases
